# Taking Authority in Projects: Why Democracy Can Hinder Product Development

When we think about working in a team, we might envision an environment where everyone's voice is heard, where every decision is reached through a collective agreement. However, too much democracy can sometimes lead to an unfocused vision, inefficiency, and subpar results. Let's dive deeper into these issues and provide case studies for a more nuanced understanding.
In product development, teams often strive to maintain a democratic approach to decision making - everyone gets a say, everyone's opinion is valued. This sounds like an ideal setup, but it can actually be quite harmful to the development process.

## 1. The Issue with Democracy in Teams

### Design by Committee
When all voices carry the same weight in decision making, the final product can become a hodgepodge of conflicting ideas. This phenomenon, known as "design by committee", can dilute the project's original vision.

#### Case Study
Consider a project to revamp a website's UI. If each team member independently contributes design ideas, you might end up with an inconsistent style that fails to provide a unified user experience. What might've started as a minimalist design could end up with excessive features and contrasting styles due to different inputs.

### Slow Decision Making
Democracy can delay decisions as each one has to be debated and agreed upon. This process can be frustrating and time-consuming, hindering the overall progress.

#### Case Study
Imagine you're developing a new feature for a mobile app. If each step of the process—from choosing the tech stack to the feature's design—needs to be collectively agreed upon, the release date could be significantly delayed, giving competitors an advantage.

### Compromise Over Quality
Democratic decision-making often leads to compromise over the best solution. The urge to accommodate everyone's input can result in a lower quality outcome.


Suppose your team is deciding on a back-end technology for a new application. To accommodate everyone's expertise and comfort, you might choose a technology that everyone knows, even though there's a better-suited technology that only a few team members are familiar with.

## 2. Understanding Why Democracy Occurs in Teams

While democratic decision-making can be useful in certain contexts, it can become a hindrance when overly applied in product development. Here's an analysis of some underlying causes.

### Absence of Clear Leadership

One major reason for democracy in teams is the lack of a recognized leader. When no individual is given or assumes the responsibility of guiding the team, a vacuum is created which is often filled by collective decision-making.

#### Case Study
In a start-up without a clear tech lead, every member might feel compelled to contribute to all aspects of product development, leading to discussions and debates on every decision, slowing down the process.

### Unclear Hierarchical Structure

Even when a leader is present, an unclear hierarchical structure can lead to democratic tendencies. If roles and responsibilities are not well-defined, team members might feel a shared ownership over every decision.

#### Case Study
Suppose you're part of a team working on a new feature. If it's not explicitly defined who has the final say on design, tech stack, or even bug fixes, each of these decisions could end up being made democratically, causing inefficiencies.

### Lack of Trust or Respect

If team members lack trust in the leader or each other's competencies, they might resort to collective decision-making as a way to counterbalance the influence of those they mistrust.

#### Case Study
Consider a scenario where the project manager lacks technical knowledge. The developer team, knowing this, might insist on democratic decision-making to dilute the influence of the non-technical project manager.

### Fear of Autocracy

Sometimes, the fear of autocracy or 'dictatorship' can lead teams to opt for democracy. The team members might prefer collective decision-making to avoid a single person having all the power.

#### Case Study
In a team where a previous leader was overly authoritarian, new leaders might face resistance when trying to make decisions alone. The team might insist on a democratic approach to avoid feeling dominated.


## 3. The Benefits of Asserting Authority 

### Focused Vision
Taking authority allows for a clear, consistent vision. By guiding the decision-making process, you can prevent the project's original vision from becoming diluted.

#### Case Study
As a project lead for a data analysis tool, you have a clear vision for a simple, easy-to-use interface. By leading key design decisions, you can ensure this vision remains central throughout the project, resulting in a cohesive final product.

### Efficiency
Decisions can be made faster and with less friction when there's a designated authority. This efficiency can keep the project on track and prevent unnecessary delays.

#### Case Study
In a team developing an e-commerce platform, you, as the project lead, can expedite decisions on critical issues like security measures or payment gateway integration, reducing the time to market.

### Quality
By asserting authority, you can ensure the highest quality solutions are implemented, without having to compromise for the sake of agreement.

#### Case Study
In a software development project, a crucial decision on the software architecture arises. As a knowledgeable lead, you advocate for an architecture that is scalable and reliable, even though it might require a steeper learning curve for some team members.

## 4. Balancing Authority with Team Involvement

While taking authority has its benefits, maintaining team involvement and morale is crucial. Let's discuss strategies for this balance.

### Encourage Input
While you guide the project's major decisions, encourage your team to provide input and suggestions. 

#### Case Study
As the lead for a SaaS product, you encourage team members to propose feature ideas, creating an environment where everyone feels valued and creativity flourishes.

### Explain Your Decisions
Transparency is key in maintaining a positive team environment. When making decisions, explain your reasoning. 

#### Case Study
If you decide to use a specific project management tool, explain your choice and its benefits to the team, so they understand the decision isn't arbitrary.

### Choose the Right Battles
Decide when to assert your authority. Allow democratic decisions on less critical matters, fostering team involvement.

#### Case Study
On a mobile app project, you could allow the team to democratically decide on the code style guide, while you make authoritative decisions on the app's architecture or critical features.

Asserting authority doesn't mean disregarding your team's input. It's about leading effectively, maintaining a balance between decisive leadership and team involvement, and aiming for the highest quality product.
