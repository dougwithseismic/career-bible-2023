# Introduction

Right. Let's get to it. I'm aiming to dump everything I know here in case someone happens across this knowledge and finds it useful.

Right now there's no structure, and I can't promise there ever will be. I'm just going to write stuff down as I think of it, and hopefully it'll be useful to someone.

Life is hard. Here's some stuff I've learned that might make it easier.
