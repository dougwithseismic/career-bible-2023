## Time to Save: Build-time Caching for Efficient API Usage

Embracing build-time caching is a clever strategy to augment your application's performance by pre-computing and storing the outcomes of expensive operations for later use. As a senior React developer focused on maintaining your speed, let's talk about how to optimize your use of caching at build time over the course of four passes:

### Pass One: Spot the Opportunity

Kick off by recognizing the segments of your application that could leverage caching. Potential candidates are API calls, database interactions, image manipulation, or any high-cost operation that doesn't necessitate repetition each time your application is activated.

#### Case Study:

You've noticed that frequent data fetches from an external API every time a specific page is accessed is slowing down your application's performance. To alleviate this, you opt to retrieve the data at build time and cache it.

```tsx
// types.ts
export interface Data {
  // Define the structure of the expected data from the API
  id: string;
  value: string;
}

// page.tsx
import { GetServerSideProps } from 'next';
import { Data } from './types';

export const getServerSideProps: GetServerSideProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data: Data[] = await res.json();

  return { props: { data } };
};

interface PageProps {
  data: Data[];
}

export default function Page({ data }: PageProps) {
  // Render using data
}

```

### Pass Two: Set Up Basic Caching

Next, execute the operation at build time and store the outcomes.

#### Case Study:

You put into practice rudimentary caching via Next.js's `getStaticProps` function, thereby fetching and caching the data during the build.

```tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';
import { Data } from './types';

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data: Data[] = await res.json();

  return { props: { data }, revalidate: 60 };
};

```

In this case, `getStaticProps` fetches and caches the data at build time. The `revalidate` parameter instructs Next.js to recreate the page once per minute at most if incoming requests occur.

### Pass Three: Optimize Your Caching Approach

Step three involves refining your caching tactics, for instance by tuning the frequency of cache updates, configuring cache headers to control client-side caching, or engaging a Content Delivery Network (CDN) to deliver your cached content nearer to your user base.

#### Case Study:

You've found that the data from the external API doesn't shift frequently, so you decide to extend the `revalidate` interval to lessen the burden on the API.

```tsx
import { GetStaticProps } from 'next';
import { Data } from './types';

export const getStaticProps: GetStaticProps = async () => {
  const res = await fetch('https://api.example.com/data');
  const data: Data[] = await res.json();

  return { props: { data }, revalidate: 3600 };
};

```

### Pass Four: Set Up Automation and Surveillance

The final phase revolves around automation and monitoring of your caching. This may entail establishing a build process to regularly update your cache, and keeping tabs on your application to confirm that the caching is delivering the desired results.

#### Case Study:

You've configured a GitHub Actions workflow to rebuild your Next.js application on an hourly basis. This ensures your cache is consistently updated, irrespective of the frequency of incoming requests.

```yaml
name: Rebuild
on

:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 * * * *'
jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v2

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v2
        with:
          node-version: 14
          
      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci
          
      - name: Build
        run: npm run build
```

To summarize, build-time caching is an advanced technique to speed up your application while conserving API resources. Mastering these stages will enable you to make the most of this strategy and deliver performant applications in the fast-paced world of React development.
