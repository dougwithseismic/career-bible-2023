To provide an entire project setup for using `react-query`, we'll create a simple React project using `create-react-app` and then install `react-query`. Here's a step-by-step guide:

First, make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. If you haven't installed Node.js, you can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/en/
After installing Node.js, you can use the `npx` command (which comes with Node.js) to create a new React application.

1. Create a new React application:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app
```

2. Once your new application is created, navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd my-app
```

3. Now, you can install `react-query` in your application:

```bash
npm install react-query
```

4. Now, you have a basic React application set up with `react-query`. You can start the application by running:

```bash
npm start
```

Your application should now be running at `http://localhost:3000/`.

To use `react-query` in your application, you will need to set up a `QueryClient` and provide it using `QueryClientProvider`. You can do this in your `index.js` file:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom";
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "react-query";
import App from "./App";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
      <App />
    </QueryClientProvider>
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

```tsx
// hooks/useCustomQuery.ts
import { useQuery } from "react-query";

/**
 * Function to fetch data. This would typically be your API call.
 * @param {string} url The url to fetch data from.
 */
async function fetchData(url: string) {
  const response = await fetch(url);

  if (!response.ok) {
    throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
  }

  return response.json();
}

/**
 * Custom hook that wraps the useQuery hook from react-query.
 * @param {string} url The url to fetch data from.
 */
export function useCustomQuery(url: string) {
  return useQuery(url, () => fetchData(url));
}
```

Now, within your components, you can use the custom hook `useCustomQuery` that we defined earlier. Here's an example of a component that fetches data from an API using `useCustomQuery`:

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { useCustomQuery } from "./hooks/useCustomQuery";

export function MyComponent() {
  const { data, isLoading, error } = useCustomQuery(
    "https://api.example.com/data"
  );

  if (isLoading) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>My Data</h1>
      {/* Render your data here */}
      {data && data.map((item) => <div key={item.id}>{item.name}</div>)}
    </div>
  );
}
```

This setup is a very basic example. Depending on your application, you might want to customize this further, add routing (with `react-router` for example), state management, etc. You can refer to the `react-query` documentation for more advanced usage: https://react-query.tanstack.com/overview.
