## **ImmerFluent**: _A Seamless State Management Technique in React_

Managing state in React can sometimes get messy, especially when dealing with nested state objects. ImmerFluent provides a smoother way to manage state using immer under the hood, but with a more straightforward interface. The key feature is that it allows you to set the state either directly or using a function, and offers an optional overwrite behavior.

### **Usage**:

1. **Directly Setting State**:

   This is the most straightforward way to set the state. You provide the new state values directly.

   ```javascript
   const handleDirectSetState = (): void => {
       setState({
           name: generateRandomName(),
           deeply: {
               nested: { first: Math.random() * 100, second: state.deeply.nested.second + 1 },
           },
       });
   }
   ```

2. **Directly Setting State with Overwrite**:

   This approach allows you to overwrite the entire state object with the values provided.

   ```javascript
   const handleDirectSetStateWithOverwrite = (): void => {
       setState(
           {
               name: generateRandomName(),
               deeply: {
                   nested: { first: Math.random() * 100, second: state.deeply.nested.second + 1 },
               },
           },
           { overwrite: true }
       );
   }
   ```

3. **Functionally Setting State**:

   This method gives you a draft state to work with, and you can directly modify this draft. Changes to the draft will be used to produce the new state.

   ```javascript
   const handleFunctionalSetState = (): void => {
       setState((draft) => {
           draft.shallowDate = new Date().toISOString();
           draft.name = generateRandomName();
           draft.deeply.nested.first += 1;
       });
   }
   ```

4. **Combining State Updates**:

   This method lets you combine multiple state updates in one go.

   ```javascript
   const handleCombinedSetState = (): void => {
       setState((draft) => {
           draft.deeply.nested.first += 3;
           draft.deeply.nested.anotherCompletely.different.madeup.nest = {
               date: new Date().toISOString(),
           };
       });
   }
   ```

### **Installation**:

- Ensure you have the `use-immer` package installed.
- Integrate the `SiteContext` and `SiteContextProvider` in your application.
- Wrap your root component (or any other component subtree) with the `SiteContextProvider`.

### **Example Component**:

Here's an example component showcasing how to use ImmerFluent:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { useSiteContext } from '@/context/SiteContext';

function ExampleComponent() {
    const { state, setState, dispatch } = useSiteContext();
    ... // Rest of the component code
}
```


With **ImmerFluent**, state management becomes more intuitive, and you can effortlessly manage complex state structures. Say goodbye to spread operators and deep clones, and embrace the simplicity and power of ImmerFluent.
