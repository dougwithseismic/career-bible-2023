# Pass One: Getting it done

#### When? Immediately.
#### Objective: It works. That's it.

The aim here is to get started. Pen on paper mode, let's go. Create your new component file (`kebab-case.tsx`) and get to work scaffolding everything you need. Move fast, stay native, and get to a point that things work.

Keep types to a minimum, don't be afraid of `[key] : any` and definitely work from one single file. `useState`, `useEffect` etc are more than enough at this stage - You can always refactor that messy logic to custom hook later on if needed. The objective is to get your code working so you can move onto Pass two.



```tsx
// Pass One: user-profile.tsx

import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

const UserProfile = () => {
  const [user, setUser] = useState<any>(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`https://api.example.com/user/1`)
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => setUser(data));
  }, []);

  if (!user) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="p-4">
      <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-2">{user.name}</h2>
      <p className="text-gray-700">{user.email}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default UserProfile;


```
